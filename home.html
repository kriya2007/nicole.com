<h2><center>Health Is More Important Than Wealth</h2></center>
<p>Some people believed that health is more important than money, I also have the same concept as them. Money cannot buy health despite having the ability to acquire the best medical system however, money is earned through hard work. If our health is affected, how would we be able to concentrate on our work to bring back the bacon home? Therefore is it vital that we remain healthy so that we can focus on our work to put food on the table.

Health can also bring joy in our life for an example, imagine that you were overseas doing all sort of crazy thing while you being healthy but all of the sudden you fell ill not being able to spend your last few day in this wonderful trip. Wealth is on the wish list for many people through out the world but having a healthy longevity is their top wish. To grow to a ripe old age to see your family tree grew is a memorable memory. Money is also known as the source of evil, it can cause dispute among family member when a sum of money is left behind without a will.

Unlike money, it can do quite the opposite effect when a love one is gravely ill family member instead of quarrelling over the asset instead show love, concern finally yet importantly Care. Our ancestor being able to live to 60 years old is consider a sage and above all better than being wealthy. Nowadays there a rapid growth of competition in the market as the world is constantly changing thus people are fighting to keep their jobs and solve their bread and butter issue forgetting how important their health in a stressful environment.

Being Overworked can lead to health problem such as fatigue, increase chance of having hypertension and other health problems. But there are some health problem that is incurable take Human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) despite nation pouring money into research it have yet find a cure. Money can be use for one personal lifestyle such as building a mansion with a swimming pool but if one is in poor health how would he be able to use it? Therefore, I conclude that health is more important than money although money can bring joy to some people life but greed will one day overcome them turning them into a demon.</p>
<p>Personal Life:</p>

<p>The importance of health in personal life cannot be minimized. It has come to be regarded as a prerequisite for optimum socio-economic development of man. Health care as a right of every individual has been recognized in many countries.

In the "Universal Declaration of the Human Rights", there are 30 articles. The Right to better living conditions and the Right to Health and Medical service are vital. Though the health is now recognized as a fundamental right of every human being, it is essentially an individual responsibility. It is the individual who has to accept certain responsibilities in order to attain good health, responsibility about diet, personal hygiene, cultivation of healthful habits, carrying out specific disease prevention measures. It is also desirable that in the personal life every individual should be acquainted with the essential health skills to stay healthy.</p>

<p>Family Life:</p>

<p>The family is a primary social group. It is a group of biologically related individuals. The family is like a 'shock absorber' to the stress and strains of life. At the time of emotional upsets, worry,anxiety, economic insecurity, the family provides an opportunity for release of tension.The family therefore plays an important part both in health and disease in the prevention and treatment of individual illnesses, in the care of children and dependent adults, and in the stabilization of the personality of both adults and children In most societies the family is the fulcrum of health services Medical schools are developing teaching programmers in family medicine; because, as Florence Nightingale had said, "the secret of national health lies in the homes of the people".</p>

<p>Social Life:</p>
<br>
Society is a group of individuals drawn together by a common bond of nearness and who act together in general for the achievement of certain common goals. The society plays an important role in the health as well as in disease; public health is an integral part of the social system. It is influenced by society and society by public health. Many public health problems are social problems and vice-versa.</center></p>
<p>How to Maintain a Good Health 

Nowadays, most people are busy with their daily work and lives which cause most of them have less time to care for their health including me. I used to eat foods that are easily to prepare in short period of time for example French fries, chicken nuggets or even pizza without paying attention to its nutrition if they are harmful or healthy for my health. According to Rockwell, high-fat foods may increase your risk for high blood cholesterol and this puts you at a higher risk for heart disease and other health conditions (2011). Here are some steps that we can follow to avoid high-fat foods, not smoking and eating foods high in vitamins help protect the eyes. There are three steps that I recommend others to follow of how to avoid fat foods, it may not work on everybody but at least it works on me.

First, making a list of good and healthy foods before going to supermarket then just follow what we have listed out and buy it for our meal. Secondly, try to put as much as foods such fresh fruits in the refrigerator so that every time we need something to eat, especially in night time, we can replace junk foods or fatty foods with fruits. Last, we need to put our health on the top of everything in life that is why we need to read the nutritional fact carefully before we buy something. Not only fatty food can affect our health but also smoking could be dangerous for us. By reading an article from Black stated that "currently some 444,000 people die annually from direct and indirect tobacco diseases (2011)." It is good to avoid smoking that everybody has to do as soon as possible to save our lives.</p>
<p>As previously stated, health education promotes a healthy lifestyle and raises awareness about the importance of health. This can be done when professionals take part in educating people on what they can do to have a healthier life. Health education doesn't just happen in schools</p>
<p>Health education is a social science that draws from the biological, environmental, psychological, physical and medical sciences to promote health and prevent disease, disability and premature death through education-driven voluntary behavior change activities</p>
<p>Health education emphasises the teaching of health information and vital skills necessary to adopt, practice, and maintain health-enhancing behaviours. Programs might include not only physical activity and proper nutrition; they can also include subjects such as stress management, drug use, and sexual conduct</p>
<p>Health education is defined as the set of philosophies and methodologies that educate the general public, healthcare practitioners, and communities about anything related to health. It draws from disciplines that include biology, environmental science, ecology, psychology, physical science, and medical science</p>
<p>Health Education helps individuals to be empowered and communities to live healthier by improving the physical, mental, emotional and social health through increasing their knowledge and influencing their attitudes on caring for their well-being</p>
<p>Health education has become one of the most important factors for raising awareness in society about health problems and common diseases and their prevention, in addition to identifying the types of medical errors and how to prevent them, in addition, to achieve patient safety goals and other important standards.</p>

<p> "HEALTH IS WEALTH"- I BELIEVE IN THIS SAYING SINCE WE CANT DO ANTHING WHEN WE ARE NOT HEALTHY. PEOPLE TEND TO FORGET THIS FACT SINCE THEY BELIEVE THAT HEALTH IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE TAKEN LIGHTLY AND THAT'S WHY MANY ILLNESSES HAVE DEVELOPED IN OUR SOCIETY WITHIN THE YEARS FOR EXAMPLE COVID19. COVID19 WOULD HAVE NOT DEVELOPED IF PEOPLE JUST MINDED PROPER HYGIENE AND PROMOTED HEALTHY THINGS RATHER THAN "THINGS" THAT CAN HARM OUR HEALTH, IF ONLY WE HUMANS JUST LOOKED OUT FOR OUR HEALTH AND THE HEALTH OF OTHERS AND THE MOTHER EARTH THEN WE WOULD NOT BE FACING CRISIS SUCH AS COVID19 AND GLOBAL WARMING ETC. HOWEVER SOME SCIENTIST TEAMED UP AND PROTESTED ABOUT THE EARTHS POLUTION, THEY PROMOTED GROWING TREES AND INFLUENCERS SIDED WITH THEM ALONG WITH FAMOUS ARTISTS AND DICTATORS AND THUS OUR EARTH IS SLOWLY IMPROVING BY EVERYONES UNITY AND HELP FROM THE MEDIA. MANKIND IS THE REASON THE WORLD IS ENDING, WHILE MANKIND IS ALSO THE REASON WHY THE EARTH IS SURVIVING THROUGHOUT THESE PAST FEW YEARS. WE ARE OUR OWN ENEMY SO WHY NOT BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND START DOING THINGS OR PROMOTING THINGS THAT ARE GOOD FOR THE HEALTH OF ALL!</p>
