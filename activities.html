<p> HEALTH ACTIVITIES </p>
<p> What are the activities of the World health Organization WHO?
WHO works worldwide to promote health, keep the world safe, and serve the vulnerable. Our goal is to ensure that a billion more people have universal health coverage, to protect a billion more people from health emergencies, and provide a further billion people with better health and well-being.</p>
<p>Health Promotion
Health promotion is the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health. It moves beyond a focus on individual behaviour towards a wide range of social and environmental interventions.</p>

<p>As a core function of public health, health promotion supports governments, communities and individuals to cope with and address health challenges. This is accomplished by building healthy public policies, creating supportive environments, and strengthening community action and personal skills.</p>

<p>The emphasis of health promotion in the Western Pacific Region is on:
Strengthening health promotion capacity (financing and infrastructure);
Promoting urban health (including healthy cities and health equity through Urban HEART);
Building other healthy settings (including schools and workplaces) and healthy islands; and
Developing health literacy</p>
